  title    = "Comparative Methods with Sampling Error and {Within‐Species}
              Variation: Contrasts Revisited and Revised",
  author   = "Felsenstein, Joseph",
  abstract = "Comparative methods analyses have usually assumed that the
              species phenotypes are the true means for those species. In most
              analyses, the actual values used are means of samples of modest
              size. The covariances of contrasts then involve both the
              covariance of evolutionary changes and a fraction of the
              within-species phenotypic covariance, the fraction depending on
              the sample size for that species. Ives et al. have shown how to
              analyze data in this case when the within-species phenotypic
              covariances are known. The present model allows them to be
              unknown and to be estimated from the data. A multivariate normal
              statistical model is used for multiple characters in samples of
              finite size from species related by a known phylogeny, under the
              usual Brownian motion model of change and with equal
              within-species phenotypic covariances. Contrasts in each
              character can be obtained both between individuals within a
              species and between species. Each contrast can be taken for all
              of the characters. These sets of contrasts, each the same
              contrast taken for different characters, are independent. The
              within-set covariances are unequal and depend on the unknown true
              covariance matrices. An expectation-maximization algorithm is
              derived for making a reduced maximum likelihood estimate of the
              covariances of evolutionary change and the within-species
              phenotypic covariances. It is available in the Contrast program
              of the PHYLIP package. Computer simulations show that the
              covariances are biased when the finiteness of sample size is not
              taken into account and that using the present model corrects the
              bias. Sampling variation reduces the power of inference of
              covariation in evolution of different characters. An extension of
              this method to incorporate estimates of additive genetic
              covariances from a simple genetic experiment is also discussed.",

              affiliation and foliar reflectance spectra of species has not

              quantifying the extent to which underlying patterns of

              reflectance spectra within three Neotropical canopy tree
              communities with varying levels of soil fertility. We interpreted
              the resulting spectral patterns of phylogenetic signal in the
              context of foliar biochemical traits that may contribute to the
              spectral-phylogenetic link. We utilized a multi-model ensemble to
              elucidate trait-spectral relationships, and quantified
              phylogenetic signal for spectral wavelengths and traits using
              Pagel's lambda statistic. Foliar reflectance spectra showed
              evidence of phylogenetic influence primarily within the visible

  abstract = "Our understanding of macroevolutionary patterns of adaptive
              evolution has greatly increased with the advent of large-scale
              phylogenetic comparative methods. Widely used Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
              (OU) models can describe an adaptive process of divergence and
              selection. However, inference of the dynamics of adaptive
              landscapes from comparative data is complicated by
              interpretational difficulties, lack of identifiability among
              parameter values and the common requirement that adaptive
              hypotheses must be assigned a priori. Here, we develop a
              reversible-jump Bayesian method of fitting multi-optima OU models
              to phylogenetic comparative data that estimates the placement and
              magnitude of adaptive shifts directly from the data. We show how

               is presented for model-based data analysis and a general

               quantity in science and is Hirotugu Akaike's basis for model

               relatively simple and easy to use in practice, but based on deep
               statistical theory. The information theoretic approaches provide
               a unified and rigorous theory, an extension of likelihood
               theory, an important application of information theory, and are

  title    = "Testing dor phylogenetic signal in comparative data: Behavioral
              traits are more labile",
  author   = "Blomberg, Simon P and Garland, Theodore and Ives, Anthony R",
  abstract = "The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based
              statistical methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency for
              related species to resemble each other, is ubiquitous. Whether
              this assertion is true for a given trait in a given lineage is an
              empirical question, but general tools for detecting and
              quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately developed. We
              present new methods for continuous-valued characters that can be
              implemented with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or
              generalized least-squares models. First, a simple randomization
              procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of
              similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I
              error rate at a nominal alpha = 0.05 and good power (0.8) for
              simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we derive a
              descriptive statistic, K, which allows valid comparisons of the
              amount of phylogenetic signal across traits and trees. Third, we
              provide two biologically motivated branch-length transformations,
              one based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of stabilizing
              selection, the other based on a new model in which character
              evolution can accelerate or decelerate (ACDC) in rate (e.g., as
              may occur during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum
              likelihood estimation of the OU (d) and ACDC (g) parameters can
              serve as tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of d
              or g near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical
              structure (a star) offers a good fit to the data. Transformations
              that improve the fit of a tree to comparative data will increase
              power to detect phylogenetic signal and may also be preferable
              for further comparative analyses, such as of correlated character
              evolution. Application of the methods to data from the literature
              revealed that, for trees with 20 or more species, 92\{\%\} of
              traits exhibited significant phylogenetic signal (randomization
              test), including behavioral and ecological ones that are thought
              to be relatively evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly adaptive)
              and/or subject to relatively strong environmental (nongenetic)
              effects or high levels of measurement error. Irrespective of
              sample size, most traits (but not body size, on average) showed
              less signal than expected given the topology, branch lengths, and
              a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K was less than one),
              which may be attributed to adaptation and/or measurement error in
              the broad sense (including errors in estimates of phenotypes,
              branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance of log K for
              all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated that behavioral traits
              exhibit lower signal than body size, morphological, life-history,
              or physiological traits. In addition, physiological traits
              (corrected for body size) showed less signal than did body size
              itself. For trees with 20 or more species, the estimated OU
              (25\{\%\} of traits) and/or ACDC (40\{\%\}) transformation
              parameter differed significantly from both zero and unity,
              indicating that a hierarchical tree with less (or occasionally
              more) structure than the original better fit the data and so
              could be preferred for comparative analyses.",

              their physiological, chemical and structural attributes, many of
              which can be detected using spectral reflectance form leaves.
              Recent technological advances for assessing optical properties of
              plants offer opportunities to detect functional traits of
              organisms and differentiate levels of biological organization
              across the tree of life. Here we connect leaf-level full range
              spectral data (400-2400 nm) of leaves to the hierarchical
              organization of plant diversity within the oak genus (Quercus)
              using field and greenhouse experiments in which environmental
              factors and plant age are controlled. We show that spectral data
              significantly differentiate populations within a species and that
              spectral similarity is significantly associated with phylogenetic
              similarity among species. We further show that hyperspectral
              information allows more accurate classification of taxa than
              spectrally-derived traits, which by definition are of lower
              dimensionality. Finally, model accuracy increases at higher
              levels in the hierarchical organization of plant diversity, such
              that we are able to better distinguish clades than species or
              populations. This pattern supports an evolutionary explanation
              for the degree of optical differentiation among plants and

              comparative methods",
  author   = "Ives, Anthony R and Midford, Peter E and Garland, Theodore",
  abstract = "Most phylogenetically based statistical methods for the analysis
              of quantitative or continuously varying phenotypic traits assume
              that variation within species is absent or at least negligible,
              which is unrealistic for many traits. Within-species variation
              has several components. Differences among populations of the same
              species may represent either phylogenetic divergence or direct
              effects of environmental factors that differ among populations
              (phenotypic plasticity). Within-population variation also
              contributes to within-species variation and includes sampling
              variation, instrument-related error, low repeatability caused by
              fluctuations in behavioral or physiological state, variation
              related to age, sex, season, or time of day, and individual
              variation within such categories. Here we develop techniques for
              analyzing phylogenetically correlated data to include
              within-species variation, or ``measurement error'' as it is often
              termed in the statistical literature. We derive methods for (i)
              univariate analyses, including measurement of ``phylogenetic
              signal,'' (ii) correlation and principal components analysis for
              multiple traits, (iii) multiple regression, and (iv) inference of
              ``functional relations,'' such as reduced major axis (RMA)
              regression. The methods are capable of incorporating measurement
              error that differs for each data point (mean value for a species
              or population), but they can be modified for special cases in
              which less is known about measurement error (e.g., when one is
              willing to assume something about the ratio of measurement error
              in two traits). We show that failure to incorporate measurement
              error can lead to both biased and imprecise (unduly uncertain)
              parameter estimates. Even previous methods that are thought to
              account for measurement error, such as conventional RMA
              regression, can be improved by explicitly incorporating
              measurement error and phylogenetic correlation. We illustrate
              these methods with examples and simulations and provide Matlab

  author    = "Butler, Marguerite A and King, Aaron A",
  abstract  = "Biologists employ phylogenetic comparative methods to study
               adaptive evolution. However, none of the popular methods model
               selection directly. We explain and develop a method based on the
               Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, first proposed by Hansen.
               Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models incorporate both selection and drift
               and are thus qualitatively different from, and more general
               than, pure drift models based on Brownian motion. Most
               importantly, OU models possess selective optima that formalize
               the notion of adaptive zone. In this article, we develop the
               method for one quantitative character, discuss interpretations
               of its parameters, and provide code implementing the method. Our
               approach allows us to translate hypotheses regarding adaptation
               in different selective regimes into explicit models, to test the
               models against data using maximum-likelihood-based model
               selection techniques, and to infer details of the evolutionary
               process. We illustrate the method using two worked examples.
               Relative to existing approaches, the direct modeling approach we
               demonstrate allows one to explore more detailed hypotheses and
               to utilize more of the information content of comparative data
               sets than existing methods. Moreover, the use of a model
               selection framework to simultaneously compare a variety of
               hypotheses advances our ability to assess alternative

  author   = "Gugger, Paul F and Cavender-Bares, Jeannine",
  abstract = "Aim The origins of the Cuban biota are of long-standing interest
              in biogeography, and the source of a small live oak (Quercus
              series Virentes) population on Cuba remains unresolved. Based on
              morphological evidence, previous authors have hypothesized a
              Florida origin from either Q. geminata or Q. virginiana or both;
              a Mexican origin from Q. oleoides; or a hybrid origin from both
              sources. We use molecular data and taxonomically informative leaf
              morphology to identify the source species and timing of
              colonization.Location Cuba, Central America, Mexico and the
              south-eastern United States.Methods We collected representative
              samples of Cuban oaks and each putative source species and
              genotyped each sample at 12 nuclear microsatellites and two
              chloroplast DNA sequences. We estimated population structure
              using a Bayesian clustering analysis and F-statistics, pairwise
              migration rates among taxa, and divergence time using an
              isolation-with-migration model. We measured seven leaf traits and
              conducted an analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) to determine which
              putative source species was most similar to Cuban oaks.Results
              Cuban oak contains one chloroplast DNA haplotype, which is common
              in southern Florida. Bayesian clustering analysis of
              microsatellites revealed that the Cuban oak forms a distinct and
              pure population cluster, and F-statistics showed that Cuban oaks
              are differentiated least from Q. virginiana and most from Q.
              geminata. Migration rates were highest out of Cuba to Q.
              oleoides. Molecular diversity, the ratio of allelic richness to
              allele size range, and effective population size of the Cuban oak
              were relatively low, suggesting a founder effect. Divergence time
              estimates fell entirely within the Pleistocene (628--6 ka),
              considering a range of mutation rates and generation times. Cuban
              oaks were morphologically most similar to Q. virginiana and least
              similar to Q. geminata.Main conclusions Molecular and
              morphological data support a Pleistocene dispersal of Q.
              virginiana from Florida to Cuba, followed by isolation and
              divergence, then limited dispersal and introgression from Cuba to
              Q. oleoides in Central America. Birds could have dispersed acorns
              to Cuba during a glacial period when sea levels were low. These
              results highlight the varied origin of the Cuban biota and the

  author   = "Adams, Dean C and Ot{\'a}rola-Castillo, Erik",
  abstract = "Summary Many ecological and evolutionary studies seek to explain
              patterns of shape variation and its covariation with other
              variables. Geometric morphometrics is often used for this
              purpose, where a set of shape variables are obtained from
              landmark coordinates following a Procrustes superimposition. We
              introduce geomorph: a software package for performing geometric
              morphometric shape analysis in the r statistical computing
              environment. Geomorph provides routines for all stages of
              landmark-based geometric morphometric analyses in two and
              three-dimensions. It is an open source package to read,
              manipulate, and digitize landmark data, generate shape variables
              via Procrustes analysis for points, curves and surfaces, perform
              statistical analyses of shape variation and covariation, and to
              provide graphical depictions of shapes and patterns of shape
              variation. An important contribution of geomorph is the ability
              to perform Procrustes superimposition on landmark points, as well
              as semilandmarks from curves and surfaces. A wide range of
              statistical methods germane to testing ecological and
              evolutionary hypotheses of shape variation are provided. These
              include standard multivariate methods such as principal
              components analysis, and approaches for multivariate regression
              and group comparison. Methods for more specialized analyses, such
              as for assessing shape allometry, comparing shape trajectories,
              examining morphological integration, and for assessing
              phylogenetic signal, are also included. Several functions are
              provided to graphically visualize results, including routines for
              examining variation in shape space, visualizing allometric
              trajectories, comparing specific shapes to one another and for
              plotting phylogenetic changes in morphospace. Finally, geomorph
